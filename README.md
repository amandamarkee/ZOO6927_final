# ZOO6927_final
ZOO6927 AI in Biology course, final project materials for creating a machine learning model that identifies Pokemon based on biological and battle statistics, and a decision tree model for classifying Pokemon into one of 18 types

## Project Overview and Criteria
> Select some data that can be analyzed with AI and work to make a notebook that walks through the process of analyzing the data.
> 
> Introduction: Describes the data and where you got the data. Describe the question being answered and the method(s) being used to answer the question.
>
> Data pre-processing: What's needed to load the data, clean the data, normalize, etc.
>
> Model setup: Setup one or more models
>
> Hyperparameter tuning: Do some playing with the model hyperparameters (learning rate, optimizer, batch size, epochs, whatever makes sense)
> 
> Results: How did the model do
> 
> Discussion: Summarize what worked, what didn't etc.
